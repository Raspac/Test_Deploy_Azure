# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To run the project, you have to access the Azure VM that we created, use the credentials to connect and run the command "npm start";
Once you do this, the web app is running, and you can access it from anywhere in your browser.

### `npm start`

Find the app in your browser.\
Open [http://datacampteam1.francecentral.cloudapp.azure.com:3000/](http://datacampteam1.francecentral.cloudapp.azure.com:3000/) to view it in your browser.
